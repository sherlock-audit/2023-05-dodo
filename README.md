### Q: Are there any additional protocol roles? If yes, please explain in detail:
There is a proxy role that has permissions stored in the ALLOWED_FLASH_LOAN structure. This role can execute opening or closing positions on behalf of the user to achieve stop loss or take profit objectives.
___

### Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
none
___

### Q: Please list any known issues/acceptable risks that should not result in a valid finding.
In some partial closure cases, if a limit value is reached, such as closing 99.99% of the position, the final swap out token may exceed the expected amount due to on-chain slippage, resulting in a failed closure. This is because in partial closures, the closure is based on the swap out token amount, while full closure is based on the debt amount. In the scenario just described, the swap out token amount is greater than the debt amount, resulting in the failure.
___

### Q: Please provide links to previous audits (if any).
none
___

### Q: Are there any off-chain mechanisms or off-chain procedures for the protocol (keeper bots, input validation expectations, etc)?
